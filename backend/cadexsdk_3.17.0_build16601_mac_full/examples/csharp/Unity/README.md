This directory contains an example of integration of CAD Exchanger SDK with Unity.

First, you need to copy dynamic libraries (*.dll files) from .\win64\vc14.1\bin and .\csharp\win64 which can be found in the root sub-directory inside the CAD Exchanger SDK package to ./Assets/Binaries subdirectory. For your convenience, you can also launch the copy_dlls.bat

For more details refer to User's Guide, section "Usage Scenarios / Integration with Unity".
