      models containing product structure only with properties attached.
    - Improved robustness parsing files with invalid data.
    - Improved reading of parts with several BRep representations.

    IGES format:
    - Revamped the file parser to significantly increase performance and improve
      compliance to the IGES specification.
    - Added support of layers (IGES levels) for subshapes in B-Rep representations.

    OBJ format:
    - Revisited general export logic: map every body of part to separate OBJ-group (surrounded
      with "g" tag) instead mapping of whole part to OBJ-group. The target OBJ-group(s) will bear
      the part's name.
    - Added a new export parameter to influence behavior of saving multiple occurrence of part
      (via instance) with distinct names by supplementing of suffix(es) (to avoid merging of
      geometries with same name during import by CAD Applications).

      to faciliate reading PMI data.
    - Added new types of measurements: radii and diameters(supported for circles and circular
      arcs) and angles (between planar faces and using three points).
    - Added search in product structure view using element names.
    - Added user-defined adjustment of font size used for displaying dimensions, radii and
      other measurements, to better fit to model sizes.
    - Improved user experience for purchase and license activation process. Introduced use
      of serial numbers.
    - Improved user experience in environment with OpenGL drivers with versions lower than
      supported (2.1). Now an explicit message is displayed explaining root-cause and providing
      recommendations instead of crash in the past.
    - Improved user experience when exporting polygonal representations to files requiring
      B-Rep format by providing more explicit warning message and requesting user's confirmation
      to proceed.
    - Improved user experience of importing assemblies with part(s) which may fail to import.
      Instead of cancellation the import process will now continue and all successful parts
      will be imported.
    - Added support of isometric/perspective view on Android.
    - Improved display of product structure view on Android phones, especially with lower
      resolutions.

      QML, Qt Meta Language).
    - Reduced file sizes when storing model in native CAD Exchanger format (XML and binary).
    - Aligned behavior of SetName() and SetAppearance() methods. The former will now remove
      internal attributes thereby reducing memory footprint.
    - Improved portability by ensuring compilation on gcc5 and gcc6. However these compilers
      are not officially supported yet.

    IGES format:
    - Improved import of product structure by creating individual parts for root MSBO (Manifold
      Solid B-Rep Objects, type 186) instead of bodies inside a single part.
    - Fixed import of colors attached to faces (type 510) inside MSBO (type 186) or
      shells (type 514).

      (type 106) entities.
    - Improved recognition of transformation matrices close to identity (e.g. due to round-off
      errors) and correct applying to geometries during import.

    OBJ format:
    - Improved recognition of objects during import. On specific files previous implementation
      could create excessive number of parts (up to 450K on a sample file) resulting in huge
      display time and memory footprint.
    - Simplified model created during import by re-assigning appearance appearances (materials,
      colors, textures, etc) to parts from triangle sets inside polygonal representations in
      the case of equal settings.

    Parasolid format (also affects JT format):
    - Extended support to Parasolid version 29.1.

    Rhino format:
    - Fixed trimming of face surfaces which previously could become untrimmed in resulting
      .3dm files during export.

      (Auto, All or specific: Advanced B-Rep, Manifold- and Non-Manifold-Surface, Edge-Based
      Wireframe).
    - Significantly improved performance of parsing STEP files (up to 3x on selected
      medium-to-large test files).
    - Improved handling of specific edge curves which previously could be sampled with too
      small steps leading to effectively infinite loops and potential memory leaks which
      could result in huge memory footprint.
    - Added support of CATIA-specific geometric validation properties in import.

    VRML format:
    - Added import of names of the product structure entities.
    - Improved robustness of the VRML reader when reading incompliant VRML files with

      and distances between B-Rep entities (vertices, edges, faces, etc).
    - Added support of textures display for formats that support textures (currently OBJ,
      Rhino, VRML).
    - Redesigned placement and display of properties by more efficient use of screen estate,
      especially when working with large models.
    - Adjusted GUI elements and layout to better comply with updated 'Universal' style
      guidelines.
    - Further improved font display, icons scaling and other visual appearances when
      working with monitors of different resolutions, up to 4K.
    - Fixed various issues with graphical elements (the news channel widget on the start
      page, scrollbars, etc).
    - Fixed navigation over subshapes in parts with B-Rep representations in the Product
      Structure panel, what previously might lead to modifying an underlying model and
      incorrect data when exporting to native format.
    - Fixed issue with the Windows installation package that could previously prevent
      upgrading installed older version.

    SDK:
    - Added full-fledged support of C# by providing complete C# API aligned with public
      C++ API. C# examples have been rewritten to use streamlined C# API instead of (now
      dropped) C++/CLI bridge.
    - Extended public API for more flexible and effective layer support. Layers can now be
      attached to scene graph elements and sub-shapes of B-Rep representations. Association
      between elements and layers can be traversed using any of them.
    - Extended low-level geometric primitive API (point, boxes, vector) for more convenient
      use.
    - Added support of parsing files located at custom file storages (e.g. cloud)
      by introducing an additional overload of Base_Reader::ReadFile() that accepts
      custom stream provider factory.
    - Added computation of minimum bounding boxes, not necessarily axis aligned.
    - Intel TBB version has been upgraded to version 2017. Customer applications using both
      CAD Exchanger and TBB should use either TBB version 2017 or any newer one.
    - Base_ReaderParameters::DelayedConversion() has been exposed into public API to
      enable user control over delayed conversion for importers which support it.
    - Enhanced logging mechanism to root-cause license activation errors.

    Multiple formats:
    - Added support of textures when importing OBJ, Rhino and VRML files.

      produce self-overlapping surfaces (e.g. when surface of revolution was defined on
      a full circle).

    IGES format:
    - Introduced major revamp of IGES importer and exporter. New converters are based on
      core CAD Exchanger architecture leveraging scalable parallelism. Other advantages
      include significantly improved work with assemblies by preserving their structures
      both for import and export.
    - IGES exporter now uses IGES B-Rep entites (Manifold Solid BRep, Type 186) to preserve
      topological connectivity information.

    OBJ format:
    - Added progress status support in OBJ exporter.
    - Added cancellation support in OBJ importer.
    - Improved import of files containing objects from multiple groups scattered throughout
      the file. Previously this could result in excessive number of root parts.

      has inconsistent linking between attribute definition entities.
    - Fixed import of user-defined properties when respective attribute's content is
      defined not in a first attribute field.

      importing and exporting files working in parallel multi-threaded mode.
    - Fixed export of open shells with attached colors.

    VRML format:
    - Added import of VRML files written in VRML v2/1997 format.
    - Added user-defined option to save a view point with the help of ViewPoint node.

    Meshers:
    - Fixed issue in computational meshers which affected sheet bodies containing
      individual faces or shells of single faces. The issue was in returning entire
      body mesh (instead of per face) for such individual faces or shells.

    Parasolid format (also affects JT format):
    - Improved import of TRIMMED_CURVES on INTERSECTION curves and SP_CURVE's on periodic
      surfaces leading to better accuracy and quality of the resulting geometry.

      read/write times.
    - Improved persistence of B-Rep representations in native CAD Exchanger formats (both
      XML and binary). This significantly reduces resulting file size and read/write times.
    - Optimized import of colors and materials by maximing reuse of unique attributes instead
      of creating copies, what allows to reduce memory footprint especially when reading
      larger ACIS, Parasolid, IGES, JT and other files with numerous equal attributes.

      possible user confusion.
    - Fixed converting XDE documents containing nested compounds as parts with attributes
      attached to subcompounds.
    - Fixed converting XDE documents containing instances (as assembly children) referring
      to other instances (as top-level shapes).

      LineSet to ensure better compliance with the VRML format specification.

    STEP format:
    - Introduced new version of the STEP importer (requires explicit activation in GUI and SDK,
      i.e. an old version is used by default). Major improvements introduced by the new STEP importer:
       - significantly improved performance (especially on multi-core systems due to parallelism);
       - introduced support of tessellated (polygonal) representations;
       - improved handling of parts with multiple bodies;

    Visualization meshers:
    - When invoking the visualization mesher with MergeFaceSets option set to false the algorithm will
      no longer attempt to merge nodes of each individual triangle set generated for each B-Rep. This
      results in improved performance and better compliance with the option intent.
    - Added support of retrieving UV-coordinates of mesh nodes. Refer to User's Guide on
      ModelAlgo_BRepMesherParameters::GetUVCoordinates() and the modelexplorer example for details.

    - Added import and export of a new format - Wavefront OBJ.
    - Fixed import of ACIS, Parasolid, JT and other formats containing B-Rep representations
      when an attribute (e.g. name or color) is associated to an edge or a face which is
      split into multiple entities.

    SDK:
    - Deprecated IGESXDE_* and STEPXDE_* classes and CadExIGESXDE and CadExSTEPXDE libraries.
      API and libraries have been kept to preserve source and binary compatibility. However users'
      applications should be updated to use IGES_* and STEP_* counterparts and CadExIGES and
      CadExSTEP libraries. Respectively, the dependency chain of the libraries have been updated.
      Users' applications distribution should now include wider lists of libraries - refer to
      CAD Exchanger SDK User's Guide Appendix.
    - Fixed a bug preventing correct setting of absolute chordal deviation value in
      ModelAlgo_BRepMesher.

    GUI:
    - Restored support of computational meshers in GUI.
    - Significantly improved performance of first display of polygonal mesh representations of 3D
      models with B-Rep representation (i.e. imported from IGES, STEP, ACIS, Parasolid, JT with
      B-Rep).
    - Fixed highlighting of the selected part or assembly which has been shown again after
      being hidden.

      support of 3D body sections by external DXF and DWG parsers.
    - Made more strict parsing of entity type and subtypes what ensures stronger compliance
      with the ACIS file format specification.
    - Added recognition of curve and surface sub-types used by ASM:
      proj_int_cur, spring_int_cur, surf_int_cur,
      loft_spl_sur, off_spl_sur, pipe_spl_sur, srf_srf_v_bl_spl_sur, sum_spl_sur, VBL_SURF.

      exact_spl_sur, cyl_spl_sur, helix_spl_line, rb_blend_spl_sur, rot_spl_sur,
      sweep_spl_sur, sweep_sur. However helix_spl_line surface will not be converted to
      resulting B-Spline surface.
    - Improved import of closed (periodic) B-Spline curves with periodicity flag incorrectly
      set to open.
    - Fixed import of closed co-edges with p-curves on periodic surfaces and vertices not

      edges.

     VRML format:

     X3D format:
     - Restored functionality to save file in meters as required by the VRML specification
       (version 3.0 used millimeters after internal polygonal mesh model was changed to use
       millimeters).

      when a part is defined in non-millimeters and when transformations are
      attached to elements other than instances (what happens extremely rarely).

      mesher.
    - Added Base_EnvironmentChecker class and __CADEX_CHECK_BUILD_ENVIRONMENT macro
      for detecting possible inconsistencies between user's and CAD Exchanger build
      environments (compiler version, compilation mode) what facilitates triaging
      errors caused by this.

    GUI:
    - Added possibility to choose between predefined and custom mesh granularity
      for the triangulation settings in the Tools/Options/Triangulation menu.

CAD Exchanger 2.4.0, Nov 2012

      of unique normals exceeds number of unique vertices for face sets already
      containing normal index vector.
    - Constructors, destructor and assignment operators of Base_String made

    - New experimental methods added to X3DGeometry3D_IndexedFaceSet to access mesh data
      more conveniently.
    - When merging face sets during creation of a mesh model from B-Rep, individual

      This ensures consistency with behavior of single face shells.
    - Exposed API to own memory allocator (Base_Allocator.hxx, still in cadex::internal
      namespace) to reduce allocations outside of it, and thereby to reduce overall
      memory footprint.

      during a first attempt.
    - Reduced verbosity of debug messages.

      vertices are now replaced with a single vertex removing duplicates. Normals are
      converted into using NormalIndex() field to enable support of different normals for
      shared vertices. This is also used in X3D and VRML exporters.

    X3D and VRML formats:
    - Changed behavior of merging faces when exporting. See the SDK section above for
      details.

      can take effect during ACIS and Parasolid imports, when there is only one root
      entity.
    - The triangulation configuration widget now allows to set absolute value for the
      visualization mesh, and also shows the relative value of the specified deflection.

    - Changed default ZLib compression level to 1 (i.e. the fastest) in exporter.
    - Fixed export of B-Rep models.

CAD Exchanger 2.4.0 Beta 2, Jun 2012

    JT format (Beta):
    - Added import of Wireframe Rep elements.
    - Fixed import of JT B-Rep element's trival pcurves on surfaces with range

      containing CAD Tag Data, rational NURBS without explicit weights, etc).
    - Added support for units other than millimeters for JT B-Rep and Wireframe Rep
      elements.

    Parasolid and JT formats:
    - Improved accuracy of importing intersection curves by reconstructing them via
      intersection of the parent analytical surfaces.

    ACIS format:
    - Fixed parsing of rolling ball surfaces for ACIS-SAT files of version 13.

    ACIS, Parasolid, and JT formats:
    - Improved import of files with pcurves with ranges different from ones of 3d curves,
      and when 3d curve ends are quite far from the pcurve's restored via surface.
    - Improved import of co-edges (or half-edges) by not relying on same parametrization
      assumption between pcurve(s) and 3D curve, and attempting to adjust pcurve if
      deviation between the curves is too large.
    - Improved continuity of imported rolling ball surfaces taking into account
      continuity of the spine curve only and ignoring possible C0-continuity of the
      support curves.
    - Improved robustness and performance of importing rolling ball surfaces.

    SDK:
    - Fixed a leak which occured when a BaseXDE_DocModel object was created with default
      constructor.
    - BaseXDE_DocModel::Roots() now skips the root shapes which have attached
      transformations and refer to the shapes which have attached invisible layer.

        transformations to coordinates;
      - materials with the same attributes are now always shared, not cloned.
    - Improved performance of computational meshers due to reusing results of meshed
      assembly component instances.
    - Meshers now always favor assembly structure, what may lead to loss of colors
      attached to different component instances (or sub-shapes thereof) due to
      limitation of the X3D format data model (used to represent a mesh model).

    ACIS and Parasolid formats:
    - Importers now try harder to upgrade C0-continous surfaces underlying offset
      surfaces to C1-continuity (previously swept surfaces on C0-curves always
      failed). C1-continuity of underlying surfaces is a requirement of CAD Exchanger
      geometrical model.

    Parasolid format:
    - Fixed import of SWEPT_SURF surfaces lying on reversed profiles. Applied similar
      fix to SPUN_SURF anticipating the same convention to be used by Parasolid, even

    - Added Base_Version.hxx to take into account SDK versions in conditional
      compilation

      previously resulted in writing wrong point coordinates.
    Parasolid format:
    - Added support of importing edges which have both 3D curve and parametric space
      curve (p-curve), to be able to read (extremely rare) files which do not comply
      with Parasolid-XT specification.

      range if it exceeds natural range of original p-curve.
    X3D and VRML format:
    - Improved export of sub-shapes with transformations - Transform entities are now
      explicitly created and sub-shapes are shared instead of creating individual
      instances of IndexedFaceSet entities with transformed coordinates. This
      significantly reduces file size in the case of assemblies.

      appending prescribed ones (e.g. myfile.STEP instead of myfile.STEP.stp in the past).
    - Both file and 3D view export dialog boxes now enforce the target format and filename
      extension as defined by selected filter type.
    SDK:

      (cylindrical, etc).
    ACIS-SAT format:
    - Respective surfaces of revolution are now recognized and encoded as cylinders.
    - Improved thread-safety in exporter: fixed potential data race in the case of shared
      underlying geometry (which normally never happens).
    - Bezier surfaces are now directly converted to B-Splines without possible
      re-approximation.
    VRML format:

      ACIS conventions (e.g. [-PI,PI] instead of former [0, 2*PI] for ellipses).
    - If a closed face (e.g. with seam-edge) lies on a cylindrical surface and their ranges
      are not aligned, then a surface is now rotated during export (to have ranges aligned).
      This is to ensure more robust reading by 3rd-party importers.
